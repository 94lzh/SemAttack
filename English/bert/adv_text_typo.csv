The customer service was 10/10, the waitress saw me struggling to eat the chicken, so she asked me if I would like her to help me open up the chicken and eat it the proper way. She got a new set of utensils and broke the chicken into pieces, and mixed it with the soup, rice and noodles. 
I would recommend their soups for colder days since the ingredients (and also the temperature) are warmer.

Manager should have stepped up and opened another register that would use cards so drive through patrons could continue their purchase.",1,1,1,2,6,"[101, 3100, 1010, 2061, 2026, 2155, 7459, 4831, 23147, 7975, 1012, 2182, 1005, 1055, 1996, 3066, 1010, 1045, 1005, 1049, 1999, 3298, 2083, 1012, 1045, 2572, 2369, 2178, 4316, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2058, 2531, 5445, 2648, 1012, 1045, 4139, 2039, 2000, 1996, 2344, 3482, 1998, 1996, 3298, 2083, 7805, 2758, 2069, 10564, 5356, 2012, 3298, 2083, 3332, 1012, 1045, 3198, 2065, 1045, 2272, 1999, 2064, 1045, 2224, 2026, 2139, 16313, 4003, 1998, 2027, 6869, 1040, 2748, 1010, 2008, 1996, 4236, 2027, 2024, 2635, 4449, 2012, 3475, 1005, 1056, 2551, 2005, 5329, 2021, 1996, 3328, 1011, 1999, 4236, 2003, 1012, 2061, 1010, 2059, 1045, 2056, 1010, 1000, 2061, 1999, 2344, 2005, 2033, 2000, 2224, 1996, 4003, 1010, 1045, 2031, 2000, 3524, 2369, 1996, 4683, 1999, 2240, 2008, 2024, 1999, 2392, 1997, 2033, 1010, 2059, 2175, 2380, 2000, 2272, 2503, 2000, 2224, 1037, 4003, 2006, 1037, 4236, 2008, 2003, 2108, 2109, 2005, 3328, 1011, 16021, 1029, 1998, 2008, 2017, 3685, 2074, 3614, 2026, 2235, 2344, 2039, 2006, 2178, 4236, 1029, 1000, 2027, 2056, 2008, 2001, 6149, 1012, 2085, 1010, 2054, 2785, 1997, 8013, 2326, 2003, 2008, 1029, 2066, 2027, 2481, 1005, 1056, 3614, 2009, 2009, 2039, 2006, 2178, 4236, 1029, 1045, 2018, 2000, 3524, 2005, 4683, 1999, 2392, 1997, 2033, 2138, 2045, 2001, 2053, 2060, 2126, 2041, 1997, 3298, 2083, 2240, 1010, 2059, 2175, 2380, 1998, 2059, 2175, 2041, 1999, 1996, 10550, 3014, 4633, 2000, 2173, 2019, 2344, 1998, 2031, 2026, 4003, 2448, 2083, 2006, 2008, 4236, 2061, 1045, 2064, 2131, 6265, 1029, 1996, 3203, 2503, 2001, 2200, 8242, 1012, 1045, 4541, 2000, 2014, 1996, 3277, 1010, 2016, 17806, 1010, 1998, 2008, 2003, 2307, 1012, 2174, 1010, 1996, 2060, 2711, 2045, 2081, 2053, 3535, 1010, 2029, 2016, 2596, 2000, 2022, 2593, 5670, 2599, 2030, 3208, 1010, 2000, 2191, 2477, 2157, 1012, 2008, 2003, 3532, 8013, 2326, 1012, 1045, 2097, 2031, 2000, 2424, 1037, 2367, 4831, 23147, 2000, 2175, 2000, 2065, 2023, 2028, 2987, 1005, 1056, 3275, 2041, 2129, 2000, 13467, 1999, 2037, 8013, 2326, 4813, 1012, 1045, 2079, 3246, 2027, 2156, 2023, 3319, 1998, 2191, 2216, 24081, 1012, 2009, 2052, 2031, 2042, 1037, 3143, 2367, 2466, 2065, 1996, 3295, 2001, 2025, 10564, 5329, 2035, 2362, 2138, 2291, 2091, 1010, 2021, 2008, 2001, 2025, 1996, 2553, 1012, 3208, 2323, 2031, 3706, 2039, 1998, 2441, 2178, 4236, 2008, 2052, 2224, 5329, 2061, 3298, 2083, 13497, 2071, 3613, 2037, 5309, 1012]","[101, 3100, 1010, 2061, 2026, 2155, 7459, 4831, 23147, 7975, 1012, 2182, 1005, 1055, 1996, 3066, 1010, 1045, 1005, 1049, 1999, 3298, 2083, 1012, 1045, 2572, 2369, 2178, 4316, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2058, 2531, 5445, 2648, 1012, 1045, 4139, 2039, 2000, 1996, 2344, 3482, 1998, 1996, 3298, 2083, 7805, 2758, 2069, 10564, 5356, 2012, 3298, 2083, 3332, 1012, 1045, 3198, 2065, 1045, 2272, 1999, 2064, 1045, 2224, 2026, 2139, 16313, 4003, 1998, 2027, 6869, 1040, 2748, 1010, 2008, 1996, 4236, 15177, 29347, 2635, 4449, 2012, 3475, 1005, 1056, 2551, 2005, 5329, 2021, 1996, 3328, 1011, 1999, 4236, 2003, 1012, 2061, 1010, 2059, 1045, 2056, 1010, 1000, 2061, 1999, 2344, 2005, 2033, 2000, 2224, 1996, 4003, 1010, 1045, 2031, 2000, 3524, 2369, 1996, 4683, 1999, 2240, 2008, 2024, 1999, 2392, 1997, 2033, 1010, 2059, 2175, 2380, 2000, 2272, 2503, 2000, 2224, 1037, 4003, 2006, 1037, 4236, 2008, 2003, 2108, 2109, 2005, 3328, 1011, 16021, 1029, 1998, 2008, 2017, 3685, 2074, 3614, 2026, 2235, 2344, 2039, 2006, 2178, 4236, 1029, 1000, 2027, 2056, 2008, 2001, 6149, 1012, 2129, 1010, 2054, 2785, 1997, 8013, 2326, 2003, 2008, 1029, 2066, 15177, 2481, 1005, 1056, 3614, 2009, 2009, 2039, 2006, 2178, 4236, 1029, 1045, 2018, 2000, 3524, 2005, 4683, 1999, 2392, 1997, 2033, 2138, 2045, 2001, 2053, 2060, 2126, 2041, 1997, 11529, 2083, 2240, 1010, 2059, 2175, 2380, 1998, 2059, 2175, 2041, 1999, 1996, 10550, 3014, 4633, 2000, 2173, 2019, 2344, 1998, 2031, 2026, 4003, 2448, 2083, 2006, 2008, 4236, 2061, 1045, 2064, 2131, 6265, 1029, 1996, 3203, 2503, 2001, 2200, 8242, 1012, 1045, 4541, 2000, 2014, 1996, 3277, 1010, 2016, 17806, 1010, 1998, 2008, 2003, 2307, 1012, 2174, 1010, 1996, 2060, 2711, 2045, 2081, 2053, 3535, 1010, 2029, 2016, 2596, 2000, 2022, 2593, 5670, 2599, 2030, 3208, 1010, 2000, 2191, 2477, 2157, 1012, 2008, 2003, 18499, 8013, 2326, 1012, 1045, 2097, 2031, 2000, 2424, 1037, 2367, 4831, 23147, 2000, 2175, 2000, 2065, 2023, 2028, 2987, 1005, 1056, 3275, 2041, 2129, 2000, 13467, 1999, 2037, 8013, 2326, 4813, 1012, 1045, 2079, 3246, 2027, 2156, 2023, 3319, 1998, 2191, 2216, 24081, 1012, 2009, 2052, 2031, 2042, 1037, 3143, 2367, 2466, 2065, 1996, 3295, 2001, 2025, 10564, 5329, 2035, 2362, 2138, 2291, 2091, 1010, 2021, 2008, 2001, 2025, 1996, 2553, 1012, 3208, 2323, 2031, 3706, 2039, 1998, 2441, 2178, 4236, 2008, 2052, 2224, 5329, 2061, 3298, 2083, 13497, 2071, 3613, 2037, 5309, 1012]",396

This is the place.  My husband is the burger/steak eating type. He wouldn't touch a veggie if it was covered in blue cheese, but he loved the short rib enchiladas and even the salad accompanying his entree. I had the butternut squash enchiladas, and before you say, yuck, you have to give it a try. I had almost changed my mind before ordering but was glad I didn't. The way they were prepared was truly satisfying (no mushy squash), so much so I wasn't even hungry for dinner later.  I have to dock the review one star because the place is pricey even for Scottsdale (2 'veggie' enchiladas with a side salad at $15 for lunch is a bit high). That said, the quality of ingredients are obvious, the blend of flavors are like nothing else I've ever had, and I left very happy someone created a restaurant that those of us who don't want heavy, unhealthy portions can actually enjoy the taste and feel good about eating.

I said I don't want anything off that griddle until it is cleaned, the cook calls the waitress up to get the pancakes, and she brings the to my daughter who starts inspecting them-in front of the waitress, and there is another piece of plastic.

I liked the Pub bar and Diablos on the property and also liked that I could walk to quite a few other properties withn a short walk.",2,2,2,1,21,"[101, 1045, 2572, 1037, 2200, 28223, 2449, 20174, 15899, 2058, 2531, 6385, 1037, 2095, 1999, 12326, 2884, 4734, 2061, 1045, 2228, 1045, 2572, 4591, 2000, 2191, 1037, 3319, 2006, 2023, 3200, 1012, 2034, 1010, 1045, 2031, 2000, 2360, 1996, 3976, 1045, 3825, 2005, 1996, 2282, 2001, 2092, 4276, 1996, 3465, 1012, 1996, 10125, 9758, 2003, 1037, 2210, 6052, 1998, 1996, 4113, 4734, 2342, 2019, 2128, 5302, 9247, 3492, 2574, 2021, 1996, 4734, 2020, 6625, 1998, 4550, 2061, 1045, 2180, 1025, 1056, 17612, 2055, 1996, 3643, 2182, 1012, 1045, 2031, 4370, 2012, 2058, 2321, 2367, 16511, 1999, 1048, 2615, 1998, 2005, 1996, 2769, 2023, 2003, 1037, 11519, 2173, 1012, 2009, 1005, 1055, 14057, 2000, 1037, 2843, 1997, 2477, 1998, 2026, 3325, 2007, 1996, 3095, 2001, 2204, 2004, 2092, 1012, 2009, 1005, 1055, 2025, 1996, 2522, 25855, 18155, 6590, 2378, 2030, 9342, 2021, 2017, 2123, 1005, 1056, 3477, 1996, 2168, 2828, 1997, 3976, 2593, 1012, 2065, 2017, 2024, 2559, 2005, 1037, 11519, 3309, 2021, 2123, 1025, 1056, 2215, 2000, 5247, 1037, 2843, 2023, 2003, 1037, 2204, 5724, 1012, 2065, 1013, 2043, 2027, 2079, 1037, 2128, 5302, 9247, 2009, 2097, 2022, 2488, 2021, 2009, 1005, 1055, 2145, 2986, 4983, 2017, 2024, 8074, 1037, 1019, 2732, 3309, 1012, 2065, 2017, 2024, 2059, 2298, 6974, 1012, 1045, 4669, 1996, 9047, 3347, 1998, 28841, 2015, 2006, 1996, 3200, 1998, 2036, 4669, 2008, 1045, 2071, 3328, 2000, 3243, 1037, 2261, 2060, 5144, 2007, 2078, 1037, 2460, 3328, 1012]","[101, 1045, 2572, 1037, 2200, 28223, 2449, 20174, 15899, 2058, 2531, 6385, 1037, 7697, 1999, 12326, 2884, 4734, 2061, 1045, 2228, 1045, 2572, 4591, 2000, 2191, 1037, 3319, 2006, 2023, 3200, 1012, 2034, 1010, 1045, 2031, 2000, 2360, 1996, 3976, 1045, 3825, 2005, 1996, 2282, 2001, 2092, 4276, 1996, 26046, 1012, 1996, 10125, 9758, 2003, 1037, 2210, 6052, 1998, 1996, 4113, 4734, 2342, 2019, 2128, 5302, 9247, 11612, 2365, 2021, 1996, 4734, 2020, 6625, 1998, 4550, 2061, 1045, 2663, 1025, 1056, 17612, 2055, 1996, 3643, 23506, 1012, 1045, 2031, 4370, 2012, 2058, 2321, 2367, 16511, 1999, 1048, 2615, 1998, 2005, 1996, 2769, 22320, 2003, 1037, 11519, 2173, 1012, 2009, 1005, 1055, 14057, 2000, 1037, 8962, 1997, 2477, 1998, 2026, 3325, 2007, 1996, 3095, 2001, 2204, 2004, 2092, 1012, 2009, 1005, 1055, 23961, 1996, 2522, 25855, 18155, 6590, 2378, 2030, 9342, 2021, 2017, 2180, 1005, 1056, 3477, 1996, 22856, 2828, 1997, 3976, 2593, 1012, 2065, 2017, 2024, 2559, 2005, 1037, 11519, 3309, 2021, 2180, 1025, 1056, 28194, 2000, 4604, 1037, 8962, 2023, 2003, 1037, 2204, 5724, 1012, 2065, 1013, 2043, 2027, 2079, 1037, 2128, 5302, 9247, 2009, 19863, 2022, 2488, 18411, 2009, 1005, 1055, 2145, 2986, 4983, 2017, 29347, 8074, 1037, 1019, 2732, 3309, 1012, 2065, 2017, 2024, 2702, 2298, 6974, 1012, 1045, 4669, 1996, 9047, 2919, 1998, 28841, 2015, 2006, 1996, 3200, 1998, 2036, 4669, 2008, 1045, 3147, 3328, 2000, 3243, 1037, 2261, 2060, 5144, 2007, 2078, 1037, 2460, 3328, 1012]",241

At that time Dr. Tosca worked at a different practice but we followed him when he moved to Kachina Family Practice a year ago, even though it is now a 30 mile round trip drive to see him.  We now have a 4 month old as well, and I can't imagine taking her to see anyone else.  

We have always been able to see Dr. Tosca same day for illness. He seems to genuinely care about all of his patients and always takes the time to answer any questions we have - will even printout out information on uncommon conditions.  He is also respectful about concerns we have, even if sometimes our views may differ some from his.  I really love that he is equally good at treating my children, my husband and me, because it is so nice to have a true family doctor.  He makes us feel as though we are his favorite patients!

We have also seen Dr. Fischbeck twice, and if I couldn't see Dr. Tosca for some reason, I would be happy seeing Dr. Fischbeck.  

Kachina's office space is very comfortable and family friendly.  The exam rooms are all warm and inviting, with personal touches from the doctors, like photos of their families or travels. 

The staff there has always been very friendly and helpful.  I love that they do reminder calls two days before your appointment.  This really helps if you have somehow forgotten about the appointment, more so than calls the day before (or no calls at all).  Unlike another reviewer, I have never felt the reception or nursing staff was rude or uncaring.  We had some major insurance problems a few months ago, and the administrative staff was very helpful and understanding.  I will admit that we probably did have a closer relationship with the reception and nursing staff at Dr. Tosca's prior practice, but everyone's personalities are different and I whole-heartedly

No waitress service for drinks, and the place was (at best) 30% full.  This brought down the energy of the room - we could tell it affected the actors.

Sundays will find brunch served with some live music. Monday to Saturday night, this place is always pretty busy, if the weather is nice then the patio (as with most places) is very busy. Friday/Saturday nights, after say 9.30/10 be prepared for potential queues to get in. Saturday night tends to not be a time I would go as the crowd seems a bit younger.

Beer: Great beer selection...in fact great beer menu! So many choices, so little time. I have to say the first time when I visited and was handed a novel style beer menu and asked for my order within 5 minutes, i was a little bit panic stricken as I had not made it past the third page. So the menu isn't exactly ""War and Peace"" but be prepared for some decent amount of searching. Beer cocktails...sound awful, are actually pretty damn tasty. 

Food: I like the food here and have eaten here several times. Mussels are good, Markt fries come with some a few dips (the mustard mayo number is really tasty), platters are decent. Most recently I had brunch and tried the Benedict, which instead of being served on a muffin is served on potato rosti, delicious dish and I would highly recommend. Bison burger, expensive but heavenly meaty goodness!

The Bar: My only complaint are the curtains that you have to fight to get through, just past the main door. I do not know how I have managed to get tangled in them so many times/trip over the bottom of them. I just find them really disorientating, like almost stepping into the wardrobe and finding you are in Narnia.

I've taken a few classes for crochet here as well.  Pat is absolutely the best teacher!  I would highly recommend taking a class with her for knit or crochet or anything she might teach.  It's completely worth the price.

You can get coupons in your e-mail, a phone ap, text messages, regular mail.  Many times they have 50% off the classes!  

My only complaint is the classroom size and sometimes you have to do your class right in the middle of the selling floor which is not conducive to learning (in my opinion)  I don't like to be gawked at while I'm trying to learn something or disrupted by giggling teenagers running around laughing and shrieking or crying toddlers who don't want to be forced to look at fabric one more second.

The stylist I had was Stacy Stray. He kind of did a bad job at it and I have to say I won't be back here again.
As for the service at reception...it was really messy and unattentive. It seemed like they were having an event or something at the salon and didn't have the patience for customers.
At the same time, I had to wait over 20 mins for my appt, which I didn't aprpeciate at all. What is the point of having an appt if you have to wait 20 mins for it anyway?

Four of us came on a Saturday night and decided to sit in the restaurant right by the open kitchen. But you can also order from the counter to go, pick up, or delivery. There were about three servers on the floor covering the 7 to 8 tables and the service was prompt and friendly. Wait time was minimal, orders were correct, questions were answered, and drinks were kept topped off.

The first two pages of the menu are sushi and the second half of the menu is split into Grill and Chinese sections. The Grill sections favors Japanese items but also has a little Hawaiian influence. From the sushi section, I'll usually get the chirashi bowl has a nice variety of fish for the price. The nigiri and rolls are pretty average. Other family members order from their hand rolls which are the perfect portion and dirt cheap. My daughter has been on a spam musubi kick and she was happy that they offered it.

I enjoyed the BBQ short ribs and was very pleased with the portion size and the seasoning on the ribs. They were grilled just right and served with a scoop of white rice and macaroni salad. Also ordered were the teriyaki beef and teriyaki chicken which come with the miso soup and a salad.
