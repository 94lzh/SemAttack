Such a positive experience.

Note: book a reservation. They were packed (and we got there at 9:30pm). I was very grateful that we had. It was also my boyfriend's birthday, so I wanted to make sure that they had that on the books. When our server greeted us, she wished him a Happy Birthday. Awesome.

The ambiance of this place is awesome. Very French, and glamorous. 

I had Champagne, and it was wonderful. Not too sweet, dry, delicious. My boyfriend had beer and he loved his too.

We started off with the Oysters. OH MY GOD. They were so good....that we ordered another round! I've never had oysters like this before. I want to go back and just order oysters.

Luckily for us, the main courses were just as wonderful. My boyfriend ordered the Steak Frites, and I ordered the Saffron Mussels and Frites. Our server let us know that we would be getting a lot of fries, so she substituted mushrooms for one of the fries. The steak was amazing, cooked perfectly. They were perfect and full of flavor. The mussels were just incredible. The saffron really came through, and they just tasted heavenly. And the frites were the best we'd ever had. 

For dessert, they brought out chocolate mousse cake with orange sauce and a pistacio brittle. It was delightful.

Our server was wonderful and so kind. She did an awesome job.

The customer service was 10/10, the waitress saw me struggling to eat the chicken, so she asked me if I would like her to help me open up the chicken and eat it the proper way. She got a new set of utensils and broke the chicken into pieces, and mixed it with the soup, rice and noodles. 
I would recommend their soups for colder days since the ingredients (and also the temperature) are warmer.

James is wonderful.

After reading the other reviews, I had my hair cut by James during a quick vacation in Vegas. I went in not really knowing what I wanted, except that I wanted a change. James was hesitant at first to tell me what to do, but when I made it clear that I wanted his opinion, he listened to what I had to say, looked carefully at my hair, and helped me decide what would be best for me. He was extremely careful, checking several times to make sure that everything was even. And he is friendly and personable, which made me much less nervous about trying a new stylist in a new town. The next time I'm in Vegas, I suspect I'll be back at Beauty to Beauty.

Let me add that I am not Asian, but I have very thick, straight hair. I suspected that a stylist used to working with a largely Asian clientele might know how to deal with my hair type, and I think I was right. James confirmed that my hair thickness is common for Asian people, though rare for Caucasians. I realize that every head of hair is different, but seeking out a stylist with lots of experience with Asian hair might make sense if you have this hair type and have had trouble finding a stylist who knows how to manage it.",4,4,4,3,7,"[101, 2009, 2003, 2035, 2995, 1012, 2508, 2003, 6919, 1012, 2044, 3752, 1996, 2060, 4391, 1010, 1045, 2018, 2026, 2606, 3013, 2011, 2508, 2076, 1037, 4248, 10885, 1999, 7136, 1012, 1045, 2253, 1999, 2025, 2428, 4209, 2054, 1045, 2359, 1010, 3272, 2008, 1045, 2359, 1037, 2689, 1012, 2508, 2001, 20221, 2012, 2034, 2000, 2425, 2033, 2054, 2000, 2079, 1010, 2021, 2043, 1045, 2081, 2009, 3154, 2008, 1045, 2359, 2010, 5448, 1010, 2002, 7791, 2000, 2054, 1045, 2018, 2000, 2360, 1010, 2246, 5362, 2012, 2026, 2606, 1010, 1998, 3271, 2033, 5630, 2054, 2052, 2022, 2190, 2005, 2033, 1012, 2002, 2001, 5186, 6176, 1010, 9361, 2195, 2335, 2000, 2191, 2469, 2008, 2673, 2001, 2130, 1012, 1998, 2002, 2003, 5379, 1998, 16115, 3468, 1010, 2029, 2081, 2033, 2172, 2625, 6091, 2055, 2667, 1037, 2047, 2358, 8516, 2923, 1999, 1037, 2047, 2237, 1012, 1996, 2279, 2051, 1045, 1005, 1049, 1999, 7136, 1010, 1045, 8343, 1045, 1005, 2222, 2022, 2067, 2012, 5053, 2000, 5053, 1012, 2292, 2033, 5587, 2008, 1045, 2572, 2025, 4004, 1010, 2021, 1045, 2031, 2200, 4317, 1010, 3442, 2606, 1012, 1045, 6878, 2008, 1037, 2358, 8516, 2923, 2109, 2000, 2551, 2007, 1037, 4321, 4004, 7396, 12260, 2453, 2113, 2129, 2000, 3066, 2007, 2026, 2606, 2828, 1010, 1998, 1045, 2228, 1045, 2001, 2157, 1012, 2508, 4484, 2008, 2026, 2606, 14983, 2003, 2691, 2005, 4004, 2111, 1010, 2295, 4678, 2005, 23368, 2015, 1012, 1045, 5382, 2008, 2296, 2132, 1997, 2606, 2003, 2367, 1010, 2021, 6224, 2041, 1037, 2358, 8516, 2923, 2007, 7167, 1997, 3325, 2007, 4004, 2606, 2453, 2191, 3168, 2065, 2017, 2031, 2023, 2606, 2828, 1998, 2031, 2018, 4390, 4531, 1037, 2358, 8516, 2923, 2040, 4282, 2129, 2000, 6133, 2009, 1012]","[101, 2009, 2003, 2035, 2995, 1012, 2508, 2003, 6919, 1012, 2044, 3752, 1996, 2060, 17480, 1010, 1045, 2018, 2026, 2606, 3013, 2011, 2508, 2076, 1037, 4248, 10885, 1999, 7136, 1012, 1045, 2253, 1999, 2025, 2428, 4209, 2054, 1045, 2359, 1010, 3272, 2008, 1045, 2359, 1037, 2689, 1012, 2508, 2001, 20221, 2012, 2034, 2000, 2425, 2033, 2054, 2000, 2079, 1010, 2021, 2043, 1045, 2081, 2009, 3154, 2008, 1045, 2359, 2010, 5448, 1010, 2002, 7791, 2000, 2054, 1045, 2018, 2000, 2360, 1010, 2246, 5362, 2012, 2026, 2606, 1010, 1998, 3271, 2033, 5630, 2054, 2052, 2022, 6203, 2005, 2033, 1012, 2002, 2001, 5186, 6176, 1010, 9361, 2195, 2335, 2000, 2191, 2469, 2008, 2673, 2001, 2130, 1012, 1998, 2002, 2003, 5379, 1998, 16115, 3468, 1010, 2029, 2081, 2033, 2172, 2625, 6091, 2055, 2667, 1037, 2047, 2358, 8516, 2923, 1999, 1037, 2047, 2237, 1012, 1996, 2279, 2051, 1045, 1005, 1049, 1999, 7136, 1010, 1045, 8343, 1045, 1005, 2222, 2022, 2067, 2012, 5053, 2000, 5053, 1012, 2292, 2033, 5587, 2008, 1045, 2572, 2025, 4004, 1010, 6414, 1045, 2031, 2200, 4317, 1010, 3442, 2606, 1012, 1045, 8343, 2008, 1037, 2358, 8516, 2923, 2109, 2000, 2551, 2007, 1037, 4321, 4004, 7396, 12260, 2453, 13399, 2129, 2000, 3066, 2007, 2026, 2606, 2828, 1010, 1998, 1045, 2228, 1045, 2001, 2157, 1012, 2508, 4484, 2008, 2026, 2606, 14983, 2003, 2691, 2005, 4004, 2111, 1010, 2295, 4678, 2005, 23368, 2015, 1012, 1045, 3305, 2008, 2296, 2132, 1997, 2606, 2003, 2367, 1010, 2021, 6224, 2041, 1037, 2358, 8516, 2923, 2007, 7167, 1997, 3325, 2007, 4004, 2606, 2453, 2191, 3168, 2065, 2017, 2031, 2023, 2606, 2828, 1998, 2031, 2907, 4390, 4531, 1037, 2358, 8516, 2923, 2040, 4282, 2129, 2000, 6133, 2009, 1012]",278

This is the place.  My husband is the burger/steak eating type. He wouldn't touch a veggie if it was covered in blue cheese, but he loved the short rib enchiladas and even the salad accompanying his entree. I had the butternut squash enchiladas, and before you say, yuck, you have to give it a try. I had almost changed my mind before ordering but was glad I didn't. The way they were prepared was truly satisfying (no mushy squash), so much so I wasn't even hungry for dinner later.  I have to dock the review one star because the place is pricey even for Scottsdale (2 'veggie' enchiladas with a side salad at $15 for lunch is a bit high). That said, the quality of ingredients are obvious, the blend of flavors are like nothing else I've ever had, and I left very happy someone created a restaurant that those of us who don't want heavy, unhealthy portions can actually enjoy the taste and feel good about eating.  One shared hummus appetizer, two orders of enchiladas, two non-alcoholic drinks (w/refills) and an order of chicken chili to go = $70 (incl. tip).  No res req'd when we arrived on a Monday at noon.

Went here last week for Winterlicious 2011 - worth every penny!
We sat at the Kitchen Rail and it is seriously, the best seat in the house.  You catch all the action in the kitchen, plus the views from out the windows, and you can even score a free appetizer on the house like we did when we were there (HAHAHA - ok, I can't guarantee everyone will score a free app, but we did).  Started out with a beautiful arugula salad, followed by the pate parfait deliciousness.  Then came our entree of the lamb ragu pasta which has big chunks of chestnuts and toasted croutons.  Dessert was this heavenly chocolate tart with caramel underneath - it was all just magnificent.  Service was top notch - completely down to earth.  Chef John runs the kitchen like a bad ass.

I liked the Pub bar and Diablos on the property and also liked that I could walk to quite a few other properties withn a short walk.",2,2,2,1,5,"[101, 1045, 2572, 1037, 2200, 28223, 2449, 20174, 15899, 2058, 2531, 6385, 1037, 2095, 1999, 12326, 2884, 4734, 2061, 1045, 2228, 1045, 2572, 4591, 2000, 2191, 1037, 3319, 2006, 2023, 3200, 1012, 2034, 1010, 1045, 2031, 2000, 2360, 1996, 3976, 1045, 3825, 2005, 1996, 2282, 2001, 2092, 4276, 1996, 3465, 1012, 1996, 10125, 9758, 2003, 1037, 2210, 6052, 1998, 1996, 4113, 4734, 2342, 2019, 2128, 5302, 9247, 3492, 2574, 2021, 1996, 4734, 2020, 6625, 1998, 4550, 2061, 1045, 2180, 1025, 1056, 17612, 2055, 1996, 3643, 2182, 1012, 1045, 2031, 4370, 2012, 2058, 2321, 2367, 16511, 1999, 1048, 2615, 1998, 2005, 1996, 2769, 2023, 2003, 1037, 11519, 2173, 1012, 2009, 1005, 1055, 14057, 2000, 1037, 2843, 1997, 2477, 1998, 2026, 3325, 2007, 1996, 3095, 2001, 2204, 2004, 2092, 1012, 2009, 1005, 1055, 2025, 1996, 2522, 25855, 18155, 6590, 2378, 2030, 9342, 2021, 2017, 2123, 1005, 1056, 3477, 1996, 2168, 2828, 1997, 3976, 2593, 1012, 2065, 2017, 2024, 2559, 2005, 1037, 11519, 3309, 2021, 2123, 1025, 1056, 2215, 2000, 5247, 1037, 2843, 2023, 2003, 1037, 2204, 5724, 1012, 2065, 1013, 2043, 2027, 2079, 1037, 2128, 5302, 9247, 2009, 2097, 2022, 2488, 2021, 2009, 1005, 1055, 2145, 2986, 4983, 2017, 2024, 8074, 1037, 1019, 2732, 3309, 1012, 2065, 2017, 2024, 2059, 2298, 6974, 1012, 1045, 4669, 1996, 9047, 3347, 1998, 28841, 2015, 2006, 1996, 3200, 1998, 2036, 4669, 2008, 1045, 2071, 3328, 2000, 3243, 1037, 2261, 2060, 5144, 2007, 2078, 1037, 2460, 3328, 1012]","[101, 1045, 12346, 1037, 2200, 28223, 2449, 20174, 15899, 2058, 2531, 6385, 1037, 2095, 1999, 12326, 2884, 4734, 2061, 1045, 2228, 1045, 2572, 4591, 2000, 2191, 1037, 3319, 2006, 2023, 3200, 1012, 2034, 1010, 1045, 2031, 2000, 2360, 1996, 3976, 1045, 3825, 2005, 1996, 2282, 2001, 2092, 4276, 1996, 3465, 1012, 1996, 10125, 9758, 2003, 1037, 2210, 6052, 1998, 1996, 4113, 4734, 2342, 2019, 2128, 5302, 9247, 3492, 2574, 2021, 1996, 4734, 2020, 6625, 1998, 4550, 2061, 1045, 2180, 1025, 1056, 17612, 2055, 1996, 3643, 2182, 1012, 1045, 2031, 4370, 2012, 2058, 2321, 2367, 16511, 1999, 1048, 2615, 1998, 2005, 1996, 2769, 2023, 2003, 1037, 11519, 2173, 1012, 2009, 1005, 1055, 14057, 2000, 1037, 2843, 1997, 2477, 1998, 2026, 3325, 2007, 1996, 3095, 2001, 2204, 1037, 2092, 1012, 2009, 1005, 1055, 2025, 1996, 2522, 25855, 18155, 6590, 2378, 2030, 9342, 2021, 2017, 2123, 1005, 1056, 3477, 1996, 2168, 2828, 1997, 3976, 2593, 1012, 2065, 2017, 2024, 2559, 2005, 1037, 11519, 3309, 2021, 2123, 1025, 1056, 2215, 2000, 5247, 1037, 2843, 2023, 12346, 1037, 15189, 5724, 1012, 2065, 1013, 2043, 2027, 2079, 1037, 2128, 5302, 9247, 2009, 2097, 2022, 2488, 6414, 2009, 1005, 1055, 2145, 2986, 4983, 2017, 2024, 8074, 1037, 1019, 2732, 3309, 1012, 2065, 2017, 2024, 2059, 2298, 6974, 1012, 1045, 4669, 1996, 9047, 3347, 1998, 28841, 2015, 2006, 1996, 3200, 1998, 2036, 4669, 2008, 1045, 2071, 3328, 2000, 3243, 1037, 2261, 2060, 5144, 2007, 2078, 1037, 2460, 3328, 1012]",241

At that time Dr. Tosca worked at a different practice but we followed him when he moved to Kachina Family Practice a year ago, even though it is now a 30 mile round trip drive to see him.  We now have a 4 month old as well, and I can't imagine taking her to see anyone else.  

We have always been able to see Dr. Tosca same day for illness. He seems to genuinely care about all of his patients and always takes the time to answer any questions we have - will even printout out information on uncommon conditions.  He is also respectful about concerns we have, even if sometimes our views may differ some from his.  I really love that he is equally good at treating my children, my husband and me, because it is so nice to have a true family doctor.  He makes us feel as though we are his favorite patients!

We have also seen Dr. Fischbeck twice, and if I couldn't see Dr. Tosca for some reason, I would be happy seeing Dr. Fischbeck.  

Kachina's office space is very comfortable and family friendly.  The exam rooms are all warm and inviting, with personal touches from the doctors, like photos of their families or travels. 

The staff there has always been very friendly and helpful.  I love that they do reminder calls two days before your appointment.  This really helps if you have somehow forgotten about the appointment, more so than calls the day before (or no calls at all).  Unlike another reviewer, I have never felt the reception or nursing staff was rude or uncaring.  We had some major insurance problems a few months ago, and the administrative staff was very helpful and understanding.  I will admit that we probably did have a closer relationship with the reception and nursing staff at Dr. Tosca's prior practice, but everyone's personalities are different and I whole-heartedly

This was a hard one to rate for me, the food was actually quite good and the interior is finished very nicely for an AYCE sushi place. The only things that apparently wasn't great was the tempura, a bit soft and the wontons were very fried (deep fried). 

We had quite a bit of different options, sashimi, rolls, comes, Yaki grill and apps. 

The mango dragon and house special rolls were great and would get them again. 

The issue with the service was this: we sat at the entrance to the elevated table section, literally the first table just by the order station. We had dish runners coming to pickup plates we finished but our order sat on the end of the table as the waiter ran by multiple times (nearly a dozen trips past). This went on for about 20 minutes until I had to chase him down to give him the order. 

To be entirely fair, they did get slammed right near the end of our meal but sitting at what is probably one of the highest traffic areas directly behind the manager/host you would think someone would notice and have helped the poor waiter out. 

Again, food was good, atmosphere was clean / bright / inviting, service could use some improvement (maybe have dish runners grabbing orders, manager picking up slack when they're slammed, something...).

The line was quickly amassing so we ordered fast - a grilled cheese and crispy taters (order these. Do not share them!) and a roasted vegetable salad and scoop of blood orange gelato for me. As we sat down and waited for our food we noticed several people eating pizza. It looked and smelled delicious. So we went back up and ordered a pizza.

My salad was okay. The dressing wasn't overly flavorful. His grilled cheese was good. The potatoes -- oh, the potatoes. Round potatoes that were uber crisp on the outside and velvety on the inside were served with a bit of fresh rosemary and a cup of chipotle ketchup. Thumbs up.

Gelato was okay. The pizza was good but the meat was a bit salty. It comes with a trio of oregano, red pepper flakes and freshly grated cheese for you to sprinkle at your own leisure.

Some of the actors are better than others.  The venue is good.  However, we had the floor seats (""golden circle""), which wasn't necessary as the less expensive seats had good visibility, too. Not worth paying extra.

No waitress service for drinks, and the place was (at best) 30% full.  This brought down the energy of the room - we could tell it affected the actors.  It was a Wed. night, and the show is early (7 pm), so that's to be expected.

As is common knowledge, Las Vegas does not have an abundance of quality aquarium/tropical fish stores and I'm not really crazy about buying tanks and stands thru the large mall/corporate stores like Petco, etc.

What can I say? A little far to drive from my home in Centennial Hills, but a family owned business for more than 20 years. SCREAMING deals on tanks and stands...they BEAT everyone else in town hands down on price...and like most stores, they dont play the game of selling you the tank at a great price only to make you pay 3X as much for a cabinet stand. They sell custom order stands and cabinets made LOCALLY and sold unfinished for REALLY fair price! I bought an 84 gallon long tank with glass top for $99...and a custom stand for $75! If you dont mind staining and clear coating the stand yourself...(mine will be stained to match my stairwell bannisters) you can save BIG $ and get EXACTLY what you want.

Very friendly and helpful staff...seemingly good selection of fish and fair prices. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is that I want to wait until my tanks and stands arrive and I complete their setup. After that, I'll be back to updaye my review based on my COMPLETED shopping experience with them.

When I walked into this place I thought oh man... this is a dump. But I learned, as always, to never judge a book solely by its cover. 

Limited seating... so we had to sit at the ""bar"". Order was taken in relatively quick time... considering the place looked slammed - despite being small in size. 

What is cool is all the food tastes very fantastic and home cooked. The grits were an A. The eggs, over easy, were real eggs and not a powdered mixture. The Waffle while not some Belgium work of art... was simplistic and tasted great. Everything just tasted like a good, home cooked meal. 

The staff, upon closer watch wasn't frantic, they were highly organized and accommodating - the hostess checked on us 3-4 times during our meal and seemed to be the main organizer as well as worker (bouncing to and from various stations)

Very pleased. Anyone who knows my ratings I only give out 5s to the best of the best.

Sundays will find brunch served with some live music. Monday to Saturday night, this place is always pretty busy, if the weather is nice then the patio (as with most places) is very busy. Friday/Saturday nights, after say 9.30/10 be prepared for potential queues to get in. Saturday night tends to not be a time I would go as the crowd seems a bit younger.

Beer: Great beer selection...in fact great beer menu! So many choices, so little time. I have to say the first time when I visited and was handed a novel style beer menu and asked for my order within 5 minutes, i was a little bit panic stricken as I had not made it past the third page. So the menu isn't exactly ""War and Peace"" but be prepared for some decent amount of searching. Beer cocktails...sound awful, are actually pretty damn tasty. 

Food: I like the food here and have eaten here several times. Mussels are good, Markt fries come with some a few dips (the mustard mayo number is really tasty), platters are decent. Most recently I had brunch and tried the Benedict, which instead of being served on a muffin is served on potato rosti, delicious dish and I would highly recommend. Bison burger, expensive but heavenly meaty goodness!

The Bar: My only complaint are the curtains that you have to fight to get through, just past the main door. I do not know how I have managed to get tangled in them so many times/trip over the bottom of them. I just find them really disorientating, like almost stepping into the wardrobe and finding you are in Narnia.

The holiest of all fast food chains (no pun intended) 

In this review I will comment on Chick-fil-A as a franchise in general as well as this specific location. 

This is the only fast food restaurant that gives me some type of vibe when I am there eating. You are greeted when you walk in, everyone is smiling, all the employees respond with ""My pleasure!"" This is an overall eating experience that you can only get from Chick-fil-A! 

As far as the food goes, it's all good, really really good! I usually go with the spicy chicken sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich or the strips. Don't forget the Polynesian sauce on EVERYTHING! One of my favorite things about Chick-fil-A is when you ask for sauce they ask you how many. EXCUSE ME?!?! You mean I don't have to use one sauce for 2 lbs of food??!?! God forbid you ask for extra sauce at McDonalds... they act like they are hand churning the sauce and packaging it up themselves. 

Once you order they hand you a little plastic cup thingy and you can go sit down. Yes, they even bring your food to you when it's ready!  Once you start to eat they even have an employee that is walking around the dining room periodically checking on you and getting you refills!!! I'll give you a second to catch your breath... 

Once I was finished with my meal I went to wash my hands and freshen up. While in the restroom I caught myself humming the instrumental music that is lightly playing throughout the restaurant but is more prominent in the restroom. The song I was humming was ""Open the eyes of my heart Lord"" I knew at this very moment I needed to go to church the following Sunday. And I just wanted to thank Chick-fil-A for getting me back into a more spiritual mood as of late since this location opened and is very accessible to me. 

I cannot say enough good things about this place. I am happy when I know I am going, I am happy while I am eating and I am happy the rest of the day knowing I ate there earlier. If I had to guess I would say I have been at Chick-fil-A hundreds and hundreds of times and ALWAYS had a pleasurable experience!

P.S. Drew the manager is absolutely spectacular. His positive attitude reflects on the entire staff and the restaurant as a whole. I am not kidding when I say I come to Chick-fil-A not only for the food but the overall dining experience, and there are not many restaurants I can say that about!",4,4,4,3,13,"[101, 6289, 2232,

I've taken a few classes for crochet here as well.  Pat is absolutely the best teacher!  I would highly recommend taking a class with her for knit or crochet or anything she might teach.  It's completely worth the price.

You can get coupons in your e-mail, a phone ap, text messages, regular mail.  Many times they have 50% off the classes!  

My only complaint is the classroom size and sometimes you have to do your class right in the middle of the selling floor which is not conducive to learning (in my opinion)  I don't like to be gawked at while I'm trying to learn something or disrupted by giggling teenagers running around laughing and shrieking or crying toddlers who don't want to be forced to look at fabric one more second.   

So if they have more than 1 class going someone has to take the sales floor - that's the only drawback.  

They also honor MIchael's coupons.",3,3,3,4,6,"[101, 1045, 1005, 1049, 1999, 2182, 2074, 2055, 2320, 1037, 2733, 1012, 1996, 3573, 2003, 2738, 2312, 1998, 2003, 2467, 4550, 1012, 1996, 28249, 2015, 2024, 4550, 2205, 1012, 2027, 2031, 1037, 3835, 27158, 4989, 1012, 1045, 2036, 15121, 8654, 1998, 2027, 2031, 1037, 3835, 4989, 1997, 6067, 2005, 2008, 2004, 2092, 1012, 1045, 2052, 2066, 2000, 2156, 2068, 4287, 1037, 3469, 4989, 1997, 3316, 1025, 2174, 2008, 2003, 2025, 2242, 2023, 3573, 2038, 2491, 2058, 1012, 1045, 1005, 2310, 2579, 1037, 2261, 4280, 2005, 13675, 23555, 2102, 2182, 2004, 2092, 1012, 6986, 2003, 7078, 1996, 2190, 3836, 999, 1045, 2052, 3811, 16755, 2635, 1037, 2465, 2007, 2014, 2005, 22404, 2030, 13675, 23555, 2102, 2030, 2505, 2016, 2453, 6570, 1012, 2009, 1005, 1055, 3294, 4276, 1996, 3976, 1012, 2017, 2064, 2131, 8648, 5644, 1999, 2115, 1041, 1011, 5653, 1010, 1037, 3042, 9706, 1010, 3793, 7696, 1010, 3180, 5653, 1012, 2116, 2335, 2027, 2031, 2753, 1003, 2125, 1996, 4280, 999, 2026, 2069, 12087, 2003, 1996, 9823, 2946, 1998, 2823, 2017, 2031, 2000, 2079, 2115, 2465, 2157, 1999, 1996, 2690, 1997, 1996, 4855, 2723, 2029, 2003, 2025, 9530, 8566, 6895, 3726, 2000, 4083, 1006, 1999, 2026, 5448, 1007, 1045, 2123, 1005, 1056, 2066, 2000, 2022, 11721, 26291, 2098, 2012, 2096, 1045, 1005, 1049, 2667, 2000, 4553, 2242, 2030, 20275, 2011, 21783, 12908, 2770, 2105, 5870, 1998, 24795, 2075, 2030, 6933, 6927, 12910, 2040, 2123, 1005, 1056, 2215, 2000, 2022, 3140, 2000, 2298, 2012, 8313, 2028, 2062, 2117, 1012, 2061, 2065, 2027, 2031, 2062, 2084, 1015, 2465, 2183, 2619, 2038, 2000, 2202, 1996, 4341, 2723, 1011, 2008, 1005, 1055, 1996, 2069, 4009, 5963, 1012, 2027, 2036, 3932, 2745, 1005, 1055, 8648, 5644, 1012]","[101, 1045, 1005, 1049, 1999, 2182, 2074, 2055, 2320, 1037, 2733, 1012, 1996, 3573, 2003, 2738, 2312, 1998, 2003, 2467, 4550, 1012, 1996, 28249, 2015, 2024, 4550, 2205, 1012, 2027, 2031, 1037, 3835, 27158, 4989, 1012, 1045, 2036, 15121, 8654, 1998, 2027, 2031, 1037, 3835, 4989, 1997, 6067, 2005, 2008, 2004, 2092, 1012, 1045, 2052, 2066, 2000, 2156, 2068, 4287, 1037, 3469, 4989, 1997, 3316, 1025, 2174, 2008, 2003, 2025, 2242, 2023, 3573, 2038, 2491, 2058, 1012, 1045, 1005, 2310, 2579, 1037, 2261, 4280, 2005, 13675, 23555, 2102, 2182, 2004, 2092, 1012, 6986, 2003, 7078, 1996, 2190, 3836, 999, 1045, 2052, 3811, 16755, 2635, 1037, 2465, 2007, 2014, 2005, 22404, 2030, 13675, 23555, 2102, 2030, 2505, 2016, 2453, 6570, 1012, 2009, 1005, 1055, 3294, 4276, 1996, 3976, 1012, 2017, 2064, 2131, 8648, 5644, 1999, 2115, 1041, 1011, 5653, 1010, 1037, 3042, 9706, 1010, 3793, 7696, 1010, 3180, 5653, 1012, 2116, 2335, 2027, 2031, 2753, 1003, 2125, 1996, 4280, 999, 2026, 2069, 12087, 2003, 1996, 9823, 2946, 1998, 2823, 2017, 2031, 2000, 2079, 2115, 2465, 2157, 1999, 1996, 2690, 1997, 1996, 20895, 2723, 2029, 2003, 2025, 9530, 8566, 6895, 3726, 2000, 4083, 1006, 1999, 2026, 5448, 1007, 1045, 2123, 1005, 1056, 2066, 2000, 2022, 11721, 26291, 2098, 2012, 2096, 1045, 1005, 1049, 2667, 2000, 6570, 2242, 2030, 20275, 2011, 21783, 12908, 2846, 2105, 5870, 1998, 24795, 2075, 2030, 6933, 6927, 12910, 2040, 2123, 1005, 1056, 2215, 2000, 2022, 2486, 2000, 2298, 2012, 8313, 2028, 2062, 2117, 1012, 2061, 2065, 2027, 2031, 2062, 2084, 1015, 2465, 2183, 2619, 2038, 2000, 2202, 1996, 4341, 2723, 1011, 2008, 1005, 1055, 1996, 2069, 6235, 5963, 1012, 2027, 2036, 2400, 2745, 1005, 1055, 8648, 5644, 1012]",280

I've purchased 6 houses-some investment & some personal residences- & this was by far the worst experience I've had with a lender. 

The process started out well, but due to a lot of factors (certainly not all being the fault of NOVA), I had to walk away from the deal.

The main issue was communication and a lack of responsiveness. I cancelled the deal two days ago and up to that point had not received a call back from Mcdermott in over a month, when I had left multiple messages- once even saying I really needed a call back that day due to a time sensitive decision I had to make. Even after getting emails from Mcdermott & his team over the last 2-3 wks when the deal was almost about too collapse & them saying they were about to call me in the next 15-20 minutes- never got a call. My realtor tried contacting them by phone multiple times & would never get a call back.

I went back and argued for my money back again and they give me 1/3 of it back. They still had to smile on that sale that Sal made after giving a 1/3 back because they still made a huge profit.

Oscar is the best part of this whole scenario. So helpful. So informative. Funny, kind, nice and oh he doesn't care that I'm a female. I'm just a person who doesn't know a thing about RVs and he's trying to help me. Oscar is awesome! So we finally head to my site and after 45mins the mental midget driving the truck, who is completely ignoring Oscar's directions, gets the thing parked somewhat straight. He gets out of the truck and says ""I didn't want to scare you but that was my first time."" No shit Sherlock. They didn't level it, they only hooked up the hoses when I asked them to and they didn't even turn the water faucet on. I later found out I had been using water that was sitting in that tank for god knows how long. Ew. They didn't turn the water heater or water pump on. They did nothing that was discussed. So now I've been calling but they don't return my calls and my 5th wheel is still not level which as I read about things more and more and speak with my neighbors is not very good for the rig at all. I would never buy anything from Camping World again, unless I had a penis maybe but probably not then either.",1,1,1,0,1,"[101, 4149, 2026, 2034, 4833, 5217, 2182, 1012, 2001, 2200, 3154, 2055, 2026,

So, it was not a good experience overall and I wouldn't recommend the salon.",1,1,1,2,1,"[101, 1045, 2699, 2023, 11090, 2005, 1996, 2034, 2051, 1998, 2001, 5327, 2008, 2027, 2052, 2079, 1037, 2204, 3105, 1012, 1996, 2358, 8516, 2923, 1045, 2018, 2001, 18566, 15926, 1012, 2002, 2785, 1997, 2106, 1037, 2919, 3105, 2012, 2009, 1998, 1045, 2031, 2000, 2360, 1045, 2180, 1005, 1056, 2022, 2067, 2182, 2153, 1012, 2004, 2005, 1996, 2326, 2012, 7684, 1012, 1012, 1012, 2009, 2001, 2428, 18307, 1998, 14477, 25970, 6024, 1012, 2009, 2790, 2066, 2027, 2020, 2383, 2019, 2724, 2030, 2242, 2012, 1996, 11090, 1998, 2134, 1005, 1056, 2031, 1996, 11752, 2005, 6304, 1012, 2012, 1996, 2168, 2051, 1010, 1045, 2018, 2000, 3524, 2058, 2322, 8117, 2015, 2005, 2026, 10439, 2102, 1010, 2029, 1045, 2134, 1005, 1056, 19804, 5051, 7405, 2618, 2012, 2035, 1012, 2054, 2003, 1996, 2391, 1997, 2383, 2019, 10439, 2102, 2065, 2017, 2031, 2000, 3524, 2322, 8117, 2015, 2005, 2009, 4312, 1029, 2061, 1010, 2009, 2001, 2025, 1037, 2204, 3325, 3452, 1998, 1045, 2876, 1005, 1056, 16755, 1996, 11090, 1012]","[101, 1045, 7099, 2023, 11090, 2005, 1996, 2034, 2051, 1998, 2001, 5327, 2008, 2027, 2052, 2079, 1037, 2204, 3105, 1012, 1996, 2358, 8516, 2923, 1045, 2018, 2001, 18566, 15926, 1012, 2002, 2785, 1997, 2106, 1037, 2919, 3105, 2012, 2009, 1998, 1045, 2031, 2000, 2360, 1045, 2180, 1005, 1056, 2022, 2067, 2182, 2153, 1012, 2004, 2005, 1996, 2326, 2012, 7684, 1012, 1012, 1012, 2009, 2001, 2428, 18307, 1998, 14477, 25970, 6024, 1012, 2009, 2790, 2066, 2027, 2020, 2383, 2019, 2724, 2030, 2242, 2012, 1996, 11090, 1998, 2134, 1005, 1056, 2031, 1996, 11752, 2005, 6304, 1012, 2012, 1996, 2168, 2051, 1010, 1045, 2018, 2000, 3524, 2058, 2322, 8117, 2015, 2005, 2026, 10439, 2102, 1010, 2029, 1045, 2134, 1005, 1056, 19804, 5051, 7405, 2618, 2012, 2035, 1012, 2054, 2003, 1996, 2391, 1997, 2383, 2019, 10439, 2102, 2065, 2017, 2031, 2000, 3524, 2322, 8117, 2015, 2005, 2009, 4312, 1029, 2061, 1010, 2009, 2001, 2025, 1037, 2204, 3325, 3452, 1998, 1045, 2876, 1005, 1056, 16755, 1996, 11090, 1012]",163

Like some other reviews, I found that the selection is very limited and food taste average.  The highlight are lobster tails and oysters- lobsters are ok and small, oysters are small thin east coast oysters (something like malpeque).  Both are not great quality like we order separately at restaurants.  Egg benedict taste awful with the hard English muffin and tough pork layer.  Smoked salmon, prosciutto, cold small dishes etc are all not the best quality too.  When everything taste just average I don't think it's worth $89, you are mainly paying for the name Ritz Carlton.  Buffet in Vegas or Asia hotels offer much better food for this price.  Desserts cave is disappointing too, I can make better pana cotta. 

The service is also the minimal you can get, I have experienced better services in other restaurants in town.  They give you what you ordered and that's it.  I've a baby with me, when I asked for hot water to warm up the milk, my server made us wait for a long time.  I saw her busy giving cakes with candles for other tables instead of giving some special attention to my table which has a hungry baby.  Eventually we had to go around to find hot water ourselves, it drawn attention from other servers, then wait again to have it.  We were celebrating our baby's arrival too but she didn't give me any cakes with candles. 

The whole buffet experience was so rushed that I didn't have time to take photos to put on Yelp!  I was rushing through fetching food and eating.  Just got to try once of everything (remember not a large selection).  For that price, with a hotel environment I expect to be able to chat and celebrate the special occasion (which people come here for).  Today's experience was disappointing for us all.

Yesterday, I was by their new location and decided to stop in.

When I walked in, there were two ladies ahead of me and they took forever. They were unable to make up their  minds and the girl behind the register was having trouble putting in the order. 

After placing my order, the girl asked me again what rice I had ordered and when she handed me the water cups she stuck her fingers on the inside of the cup. I could tell she had not been trained on common sanitary procedures. Also everything about her and the process of placing my order was extremely slow.

As soon as the tray was put down on the table I saw that the side of pita was burnt. Also, the pita containing the gyros meat was drenched in grease. The gyros meat was tasty as usual and both sides were good enough. However, I am not a huge fan of their hummus because it is has zero flavor. The baklava's phyllo dough was also dry. 

Stephano's is a great Greek fast casual alternative to Daphne's Greek Cafe that serves artificially tasting Greek food. The food also comes relatively quickly no matter how busy they are and the food is consistent.",2,2,2,1,8,"[101, 1045, 2034, 2699, 15963, 2080, 1005, 1055, 2006, 5374, 12602, 1998, 2031, 2144, 2042, 1037, 5470, 1012, 7483, 1010, 1045, 2001, 2011, 2037, 2047, 3295, 1998, 2787, 2000, 2644, 1999, 1012, 2043, 1045, 2939, 1999, 1010, 2045, 2020, 2048, 6456, 3805, 1997, 2033, 1998, 2027, 2165, 5091, 1012, 2027, 2020, 4039, 2000, 2191, 2039, 2037, 9273, 1998, 1996, 2611, 2369, 1996, 4236, 2001, 2383, 4390, 5128, 1999, 1996, 2344, 1012, 2044, 6885, 2026, 2344, 1010, 1996, 2611, 2356, 2033, 2153, 2054, 5785, 1045, 2018, 3641, 1998, 2043, 2016, 4375, 2033, 1996, 2300, 10268, 2016, 5881, 2014, 3093, 2006, 1996, 2503, 1997, 1996, 2452, 1012, 1045, 2071, 2425, 2016, 2018, 2025, 2042, 4738, 2006, 2691, 25480, 8853, 1012, 2036, 2673, 2055, 2014, 1998, 1996, 2832, 1997, 6885, 2026, 2344, 2001, 5186, 4030, 1012, 2004, 2574, 2004, 1996, 11851, 2001, 2404, 2091, 2006, 1996, 2795, 1045, 2387, 2008, 1996, 2217, 1997, 6770, 2050, 2001, 11060, 1012, 2036, 1010, 1996, 6770, 2050, 4820, 1996, 1043, 12541, 2891, 6240, 2001, 25265, 1999, 21956, 1012, 1996, 1043, 12541, 2891, 6240, 2001, 11937, 21756, 2004, 5156, 1998, 2119, 3903, 2020, 2204, 2438, 1012, 2174, 1010, 1045, 2572, 2025, 1037, 4121, 5470, 1997, 2037, 14910, 7606, 2138, 2009, 2003, 2038, 5717, 14894, 1012, 1996, 8670, 26086, 3567, 1005, 1055, 6887, 8516, 4135, 23126, 2001, 2036, 4318, 1012, 15963, 2080, 1005, 1055, 2003, 1037, 2307, 3306, 3435, 10017, 4522, 2000, 16847, 1005, 1055, 3306, 7668, 2008, 4240, 7976, 2135, 18767, 3306, 2833, 1012, 1996, 2833, 2036, 3310, 4659, 2855, 2053, 3043, 2129, 5697, 2027, 2024, 1998, 1996, 2833, 2003, 8335, 1012]","[101, 1045, 2034, 2699, 15963, 2080, 1005, 1055, 2006, 5374, 12602, 1998, 2031, 2144, 2042, 1037, 5470, 1012, 7483, 1010, 1045, 2001, 2011, 2037, 2047, 3295, 1998, 2787, 2000, 2644, 4960, 1012, 2043, 1045, 2939, 4960, 1010, 2045, 2020, 2048, 6456, 3805, 1997, 2033, 1998, 2027, 2165, 5091, 1012, 2027, 2020, 4039, 2000, 2191, 2039, 2037, 9273, 1998, 1996, 2611, 2369, 1996, 4236, 2001, 2383, 4390, 5128, 4960, 1996, 2344, 1012, 2044, 6885, 2026, 2344, 1010, 1996, 2611, 2356, 2033, 2153, 2054, 5785, 1045, 2018, 3641, 1998, 2043, 2016, 3413, 2033, 1996, 17996, 10268, 2016, 5881, 2014, 3093, 2006, 1996, 2503, 1997, 1996, 2452, 1012, 1045, 2071, 2425, 2016, 2018, 2025, 2042, 4738, 2006, 2691, 25480, 8853, 1012, 2036, 2673, 2055, 2014, 1998, 1996, 2832, 1997, 6885, 2026, 2344, 2001, 5186, 4030, 1012, 2004, 2574, 2004, 1996, 11851, 2001, 2404, 14777, 2006, 1996, 2795, 1045, 2387, 2008, 1996, 2217, 1997, 6770, 2050, 2001, 11060, 1012, 2036, 1010, 1996, 6770, 2050, 4820, 1996, 1043, 12541, 2891, 6240, 2001, 25265, 1999, 21956, 1012, 1996, 1043, 12541, 2891, 6240, 2001, 11937, 21756, 2004, 5156, 1998, 2119, 3903, 12346, 2204, 2438, 1012, 2174, 1010, 1045, 2572, 2025, 1037, 4121, 5470, 1997, 2037, 14910, 7606, 2138, 2009, 2003, 2038, 5717, 14894, 1012, 1996, 8670, 26086, 3567, 1005, 1055, 6887, 8516, 4135, 23126, 2001, 2036, 4318, 1012, 15963, 2080, 1005, 1055, 2003, 1037, 2307, 3306, 3435, 10017, 4522, 2000, 16847, 1005, 1055, 3306, 7668, 2008, 4240, 7976, 2135, 18767, 3306, 2833, 1012, 1996, 2833, 2036, 3310, 4659, 2855, 2053, 3043, 2129, 5697, 2027, 12346, 1998, 1996, 2833, 2003, 8335, 1012]",264

We had dinner at the restaurant so we had to go back out to the entrance to get our bracelets before heading upstairs to the club. Once inside, it was nearly impossible to reach any of the bars.. This place was PACKED!! There was no way to walk through without pushing up against everyone (not my favorite thing). We finally got to a spot were our group could dance and move comfortably.

Four of us came on a Saturday night and decided to sit in the restaurant right by the open kitchen. But you can also order from the counter to go, pick up, or delivery. There were about three servers on the floor covering the 7 to 8 tables and the service was prompt and friendly. Wait time was minimal, orders were correct, questions were answered, and drinks were kept topped off.

The first two pages of the menu are sushi and the second half of the menu is split into Grill and Chinese sections. The Grill sections favors Japanese items but also has a little Hawaiian influence. From the sushi section, I'll usually get the chirashi bowl has a nice variety of fish for the price. The nigiri and rolls are pretty average. Other family members order from their hand rolls which are the perfect portion and dirt cheap. My daughter has been on a spam musubi kick and she was happy that they offered it.

I enjoyed the BBQ short ribs and was very pleased with the portion size and the seasoning on the ribs. They were grilled just right and served with a scoop of white rice and macaroni salad. Also ordered were the teriyaki beef and teriyaki chicken which come with the miso soup and a salad. My wife ordered the chicken lettuce wraps which of course I had one wrap and the chicken was well seasoned in fresh, crispy lettuce.

My reservation host, Sergio, was extremely friendly and had multiple suggestions to maximize my three night trip (it's been 24 years since the last time I visited.). This morning, I woke up in this beautiful suite and there was a hand written note under the door - Sergio reminding me to enjoy my stay here from the hectic work world and see the sights that have changed over the last 24 years - talk about customer service!

Our room was beautiful, lavishly furnished with every conceivable amenity waiting for you.  The bathroom's soak in tub help to melt away work stresses and set the stage for a relaxing but fun filled trip.  Down covered king bed and pillows made for an easy night's sleep.

We enjoyed four of the onsite restaurants, all of which had superb service and spectacular food -- absolutely fabulous!!  I especially enjoyed the avocado toast at the express counter and green tea ice cream at the buffet.

The La Reve show was truly awesome, grateful to have been center stage and feel a part of the aerobatic experience.  Very beautiful and thrilling show, don't miss out!
